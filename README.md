## Overview
This time, I've chosen a project that will help me dive into the world of APIs. Fetching data has always been a mysterious territory for me, and I'm want to explore it further. 

And this time, I'll be utilizing the [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework.

The jounary will be fun and fullfillment. I know.
### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes

## My process
### Built with
- Setup Next.js environment
- Import Image and Default Setting from Figma
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Poistion
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fetch data from Github API 
- [tailwindcss](https://https://tailwindcss.com/) - For CSS
- [Next.js]https://nextjs.org/ - For React Framework

## New Stuff for me
- Setup dark mode with tailwindcss on Next.js
  - It's quite a challenge! Spent the entire day searching for a solution and finally cracked it. Also, got the opportunity to learn about the new, for me, React Hook `useContext`. It's like a global `useState`, allowing for seamless state management across components.
- Change SVG color
  - I haven't thought it would be a challenge. It took some time and experimentation to figure it out. I use SVG become React Component and minifiy it. Don't forget to remove `fill` attribtue in svg fill.
  - Solution provided below.
- fetch data, `Postman` is always best solution with API.
-  more css arrangement
- Know JavaScript string method `starWith()`.
### Continued development

After completing all the features in this challenge, I'm motivated to refactor the code. I'll focus on modifying the index.js file to handle data fetching and simplifying each component's responsibilities to improve code clarity. And..., I plan to do skeleton animations during data fetching. It will look nice and more userfriendly.

In my next challenge, I aim to tackle more complex APIs and create a more user-friendly interface. Excited for the journey ahead!
